🌍 World Explorer – Interactive Country Information App
World Explorer is a React-based web application designed to provide users with detailed information about countries around the world. The app fetches real-time data from the REST Countries API, allowing users to explore key details such as population, region, capital, official languages, and currencies.

🔹 Key Features:
✅ Search & Filter Functionality – Users can search for countries by name and filter them by region for a more refined experience.
✅ Detailed Country Pages – Clicking on a country card provides additional details about its geography, demographics, and borders.
✅ Dark Mode Support – The app offers a seamless light/dark theme toggle for an improved user experience.
✅ Fully Responsive Design – Ensures an optimal layout on both desktop and mobile devices.

🛠 Tech Stack:
React.js (Component-based architecture)
JavaScript (ES6+)
CSS (Flexbox & Grid for responsiveness)
REST API Integration
This project showcases my ability to build dynamic and responsive web applications using modern front-end technologies. It strengthened my skills in API handling, state management, and UI/UX design.
